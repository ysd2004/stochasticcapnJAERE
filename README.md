0 Manuscript information
====================================
To implement the V-approximation suggested in the manuscript, we provide the pre-defined R-functions. Before replication the following examples, these functions should be loaded at first.

```r
  Abbott, K. Joshua, Eli P. Fenichel, and Seong, D. Yun, "Risky (Natural) Assets: Stochasticity and the Value of Natural Capital"
```

1 Example 1: Optimized and non-optimized renewable resource management under convexity
====================================
This code replicates Figure 2 and Figure 3 in the manuscript.\
Download the replication R-file from this repository into your working directory.
